          growing up in a small village in Mosul, Iraq, and from childhood, I
          was immersed by technology. my father got me my first computer in
          2004. back then I was only playing games and thinking about how these
          games are made.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          when I grow up I started questioning and researching on how games are
          made. I found out that programming is one of the main pillars of game
          development. so I decided to learn.

          and as I started learning. a war has started in my city, a war that is
          considered one of the most brutal wars in modern history. during the
          war, I started to read books on Python and C++ and tried to learn but
          there was no chance of learning there was no hope for me of getting
          out. In the end, the war ended, and from that time I have started
          learning coding through an organization called Re:Coded {`it's`} an
          organization that teaches youth in conflict-affected areas how to code
          and get into the digital economy.
