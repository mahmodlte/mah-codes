          Born and raised in a small village in Mosul, Iraq, I was fascinated by
          technology from a young age. My father got me my first computer when I
          was 6. It opened up a whole new world for me. I was curious about how
          the video games I was playing were made. Later I found out that video
          games were made with lines of code, so I decided to learn computer
          programming on my own.

          As I started learning, war started in my city and change my life. I
          tried to continue my self-education by reading on Python and C++, but
          there was little hope for an education during conflict. After the war
          ended, I started a coding boocamp with an international organization
          called Re:Coded, where I found a community of technologists and learn
          the skills I needed to become a developer. Today, I leverage my skills
          and life experience to build products for local and international
          clients.
